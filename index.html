            <article>
                <p>The tomato (/təmeɪtoʊ/ or /təmɑːtoʊ/) is the edible berry of the plant Solanum lycopersicum, commonly
                    known as the tomato plant. The species originated in western South America, Mexico, and Central
                    America.
                    The Nahuatl word tomatl gave rise to the Spanish word tomate, from which the English word tomato
                    derived. Its domestication and use as a cultivated food may have originated with the indigenous
                    peoples
                    of Mexico. The Aztecs used tomatoes in their cooking at the time of the Spanish conquest of the
                    Aztec
                    Empire, and after the Spanish encountered the tomato for the first time after their contact with the
                    Aztecs, they brought the plant to Europe, in a widespread transfer of plants known as the Columbian
                    exchange. From there, the tomato was introduced to other parts of the European-colonized world
                    during
                    the 16th century.</p>
                <p>Tomatoes are a significant source of umami flavor. They are consumed in diverse ways: raw or cooked,
                    and
                    in many dishes, sauces, salads, and drinks. While tomatoes are fruits—botanically classified as
                    berries—they are commonly used culinarily as a vegetable ingredient or side dish.</p>
                <p>Numerous varieties of the tomato plant are widely grown in temperate climates across the world, with
                    greenhouses allowing for the production of tomatoes throughout all seasons of the year. Tomato
                    plants
                    typically grow to 1–3 meters (3–10 ft) in height. They are vines that have a weak stem that sprawls
                    and
                    typically needs support. Indeterminate tomato plants are perennials in their native habitat, but are
                    cultivated as annuals. (Determinate, or bush, plants are annuals that stop growing at a certain
                    height
                    and produce a crop all at once.) The size of the tomato varies according to the cultivar, with a
                    range
                    of 1–10 cm (1⁄2–4 in) in width.</p>

                <h2>HISTORY</h2>
                <hr>
                <p> The wild ancestor of the tomato, Solanum pimpinellifolium, is native to western South America. These
                    wild versions were the size of peas. The first evidence of domestication points to the Aztecs and
                    other
                    peoples in Mesoamerica, who used the fruit fresh and in their cooking. The Spanish first introduced
                    tomatoes to Europe, where they became used in Spanish food. In France, Italy and northern Europe,
                    the
                    tomato was initially grown as an ornamental plant. It was regarded with suspicion as a food because
                    botanists recognized it as a nightshade, a relative of the poisonous belladonna. This was
                    exacerbated by
                    the interaction of the tomato's acidic juice with pewter plates. The leaves and fruit contain
                    tomatine,
                    which in large quantities would be toxic. However, the ripe fruit contains a much lower amount of
                    tomatine than the immature fruit.</p>
                <ul>
                    <h3>Mesoamerica</h3>
                    <p>The exact date of domestication is unknown; by 500 BC, it was already being cultivated in
                        southern
                        Mexico and probably other areas. The Pueblo people are thought to have believed that those who
                        witnessed the ingestion of tomato seeds were blessed with powers of divination. The large, lumpy
                        variety of tomato, a mutation from a smoother, smaller fruit, originated in Mesoamerica, and may
                        be
                        the direct ancestor of some modern cultivated tomatoes.</p>
                    <h3>Spanish distribution</h3>
                    <p>Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés may have been the first to transfer a small yellow tomato to
                        Europe after he captured the Aztec city of Tenochtitlan, now Mexico City, in 1521. The earliest
                        discussion of the tomato in European literature appeared in a herbal written in 1544 by Pietro
                        Andrea Mattioli, an Italian physician and botanist, who suggested that a new type of eggplant
                        had
                        been brought to Italy that was blood red or golden color when mature and could be divided into
                        segments and eaten like an eggplant—that is, cooked and seasoned with salt, black pepper, and
                        oil.
                        It was not until ten years later that tomatoes were named in print by Mattioli as pomi d'oro, or
                        "golden apples".</p>
                    <p>After the Spanish colonization of the Americas, the Spanish distributed the tomato throughout
                        their
                        colonies in the Caribbean. They also took it to the Philippines, from where it spread to
                        southeast
                        Asia and then the entire Asian continent. The Spanish also brought the tomato to Europe. It grew
                        easily in Mediterranean climates, and cultivation began in the 1540s. It was probably eaten
                        shortly
                        after it was introduced, and was certainly being used as food by the early 17th century in
                        Spain.
                    </p>
                    <h3>China</h3>
                    <p>The tomato was introduced to China, likely via the Philippines or Macau, in the 1500s. It was
                        given
                        the name 番茄 fānqié (foreign eggplant), as the Chinese named many foodstuffs introduced from
                        abroad,
                        but referring specifically to early introductions</p>
                    <h3>Italy</h3>
                    <p>The recorded history of tomatoes in Italy dates back to at least 31 October 1548, when the house
                        steward of Cosimo de' Medici, the grand duke of Tuscany, wrote to the Medici private secretary
                        informing him that the basket of tomatoes sent from the grand duke's Florentine estate at Torre
                        del
                        Gallo "had arrived safely". Tomatoes were grown mainly as ornamentals early on after their
                        arrival
                        in Italy. For example, the Florentine aristocrat Giovanvettorio Soderini wrote how they "were to
                        be
                        sought only for their beauty", and were grown only in gardens or flower beds. The tomato's
                        ability
                        to mutate and create new and different varieties helped contribute to its success and spread
                        throughout Italy. However, in areas where the climate supported growing tomatoes, their habit of
                        growing to the ground suggested low status. They were not adopted as a staple of the peasant
                        population because they were not as filling as other fruits already available. Additionally,
                        both
                        toxic and inedible varieties discouraged many people from attempting to consume or prepare any
                        other
                        varieties. In certain areas of Italy, such as Florence, the fruit was used solely as a tabletop
                        decoration, until it was incorporated into the local cuisine in the late 17th or early 18th
                        century.
                        The earliest discovered cookbook with tomato recipes was published in Naples in 1692, though the
                        author had apparently obtained these recipes from Spanish sources</p>
                    <h3>Britain</h3>
                    <p>Tomatoes were not grown in England until the 1590s. One of the earliest cultivators was John
                        Gerard,
                        a barber-surgeon. Gerard's Herbal, published in 1597, and largely plagiarized from continental
                        sources, is also one of the earliest discussions of the tomato in England. Gerard knew the
                        tomato
                        was eaten in Spain and Italy. Nonetheless, he believed it was poisonous (in fact, the plant and
                        raw
                        fruit do have low levels of tomatine, but are not generally dangerous; see below). Gerard's
                        views
                        were influential, and the tomato was considered unfit for eating (though not necessarily
                        poisonous)
                        for many years in Britain and its North American colonies.</p>
                    <p>However, by the mid-18th century, tomatoes were widely eaten in Britain, and before the end of
                        that
                        century, the Encyclopædia Britannica stated the tomato was "in daily use" in soups, broths, and
                        as a
                        garnish. They were not part of the average person's diet, and though by 1820 they were described
                        as
                        "to be seen in great abundance in all our vegetable markets" and to be "used by all our best
                        cooks",
                        reference was made to their cultivation in gardens still "for the singularity of their
                        appearance",
                        while their use in cooking was associated with exotic Italian or Jewish cuisine</p>
                    <h3>Middle East and North Africa</h3>
                    <p>The tomato was introduced to cultivation in the Middle East by John Barker, British consul in
                        Aleppo
                        c. 1799 to 1825. Nineteenth century descriptions of its consumption are uniformly as an
                        ingredient
                        in a cooked dish. In 1881, it is described as only eaten in the region "within the last forty
                        years". Today, the tomato is a critical and ubiquitous part of Middle Eastern cuisine, served
                        fresh
                        in salads (e.g., Arab salad, Israeli salad, Shirazi salad and Turkish salad), grilled with
                        kebabs
                        and other dishes, made into sauces, and so on.</p>
                    <h3>United States</h3>
                    <p>The earliest reference to tomatoes being grown in British North America is from 1710, when
                        herbalist
                        William Salmon reported seeing them in what is today South Carolina. They may have been
                        introduced
                        from the Caribbean. By the mid-18th century, they were cultivated on some Carolina plantations,
                        and
                        probably in other parts of the Southeast as well. Thomas Jefferson, who ate tomatoes in Paris,
                        sent
                        some seeds back to America. Some early American advocates of the culinary use of the tomato
                        included
                        Michele Felice Cornè and Robert Gibbon Johnson.[24] Many Americans considered tomatoes to be
                        poisonous at this time; and in general, they were grown more as ornamental plants than as food.
                        In
                        1897, W. H. Garrison addressed the Medico-Legal Society of New York stating, "The belief was
                        once
                        transmitted that the tomato was sinisterly dangerous." He recalled in his youth tomatoes were
                        dubbed
                        "love-apples or wolf-apples" and they were shunned as "globes of the devil."[25]

                    <p>Alexander W. Livingston receives much credit for developing numerous varieties of tomato for both
                        home and commercial gardeners.</p>

                    <p>Early tomato breeders included Henry Tilden in Iowa and a Dr. Hand in Baltimore. The U.S.
                        Department
                        of Agriculture's 1937 yearbook declared that "half of the major varieties were a result of the
                        abilities of the Livingstons to evaluate and perpetuate superior material in the tomato."
                        Livingston's first breed of tomato, the Paragon, was introduced in 1870, the beginning of a
                        great
                        tomato culture enterprise in the county. In 1875, he introduced the Acme, which was said to be
                        involved in the parentage of most of the tomatoes introduced by him and his competitors for the
                        next
                        twenty-five years.</p>

                    <p>When Livingston began his attempts to develop the tomato as a commercial crop, his aim had been
                        to
                        grow tomatoes smooth in contour, uniform in size, and sweet in flavor. He eventually developed
                        over
                        seventeen different varieties of the tomato plant. Today, the crop is grown in every state in
                        the
                        Union.</p>
                    <h3>Modern commercial varieties</h3>
                    <p>The poor taste and lack of sugar in modern garden and commercial tomato varieties resulted from
                        breeding tomatoes to ripen uniformly red. This change occurred after discovery of a mutant "u"
                        phenotype in the mid-20th century, so named because the fruits ripened uniformly. This was
                        widely
                        cross-bred to produce red fruit without the typical green ring around the stem on uncross-bred
                        varieties. Prior to general introduction of this trait, most tomatoes produced more sugar during
                        ripening, and were sweeter and more flavorful.</p>
                    <h3>Etymology</h3>
                    <hr>
                    <p>The word tomato comes from the Spanish tomate, which in turn comes from the Nahuatl word tomatl
                        [ˈtomat͡ɬ], meaning 'swelling fruit'; also 'fat water' or 'fat thing'. The native Mexican
                        tomatillo
                        is tomate. When Aztecs started to cultivate the fruit to be larger, sweeter and red, they called
                        the
                        new variety xitomatl (or jitomates) (pronounced [ʃiːˈtomatɬ]), ('plump with navel' or 'fat water
                        with navel'). The specific name lycopersicum (from the 1753 book Species Plantarum) is of Greek
                        origin (λύκοπερσικων, lykopersikon), meaning 'wolf peach'.</p>

                </center>

                <p>Tomato plants are vines, initially decumbent, typically growing 180 cm (6 ft) or more above the
                    ground if
                    supported, although erect bush varieties have been bred, generally 100 cm (3 ft 3 in) tall or
                    shorter.
                    Indeterminate types are "tender" perennials, dying annually in temperate climates (they are
                    originally
                    native to tropical highlands), although they can live up to three years in a greenhouse in some
                    cases.
                    Determinate types are annual in all climates</p>
                <p>Tomato plants are dicots, and grow as a series of branching stems, with a terminal bud at the tip
                    that
                    does the actual growing. When the tip eventually stops growing, whether because of pruning or
                    flowering,
                    lateral buds take over and grow into other, fully functional, vines.</p>
                <p>Tomato vines are typically pubescent, meaning covered with fine short hairs. The hairs facilitate the
                    vining process, turning into roots wherever the plant is in contact with the ground and moisture,
                    especially if the vine's connection to its original root has been damaged or severed</p>
                <p>The leaves are 10–25 cm (4–10 in) long, odd pinnate, with five to nine leaflets on petioles,[44] each
                    leaflet up to 8 cm (3 in) long, with a serrated margin; both the stem and leaves are densely
                    glandular-hairy</p>
                <p>Their flowers, appearing on the apical meristem, have the anthers fused along the edges, forming a
                    column
                    surrounding the pistil's style. Flowers in domestic cultivars can be self-fertilizing. The flowers
                    are
                    1–2 cm (1⁄2–3⁄4 in) across, yellow, with five pointed lobes on the corolla; they are borne in a cyme
                    of
                    three to 12 together.</p>
                <p>Although in culinary terms, tomato is regarded as a vegetable, its fruit is classified botanically as
                    a
                    berry.[45] As a true fruit, it develops from the ovary of the plant after fertilization, its flesh
                    comprising the pericarp walls. The fruit contains hollow spaces full of seeds and moisture, called
                    locular cavities. These vary, among cultivated species, according to type. Some smaller varieties
                    have
                    two cavities, globe-shaped varieties typically have three to five, beefsteak tomatoes have a great
                    number of smaller cavities, while paste tomatoes have very few, very small cavities.</p>
                <h3>Fruit versus vegetable</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>Botanically, a tomato is a fruit—a berry, consisting of the ovary, together with its seeds, of a
                    flowering plant. However, the tomato is considered a "culinary vegetable" because it has a much
                    lower
                    sugar content than culinary fruits; because it is more savoury (umami) than sweet, it is typically
                    served as part of a salad or main course of a meal, rather than as a dessert. Tomatoes are not the
                    only
                    food source with this ambiguity; bell peppers, cucumbers, green beans, aubergines/eggplants,
                    avocados,
                    and squashes of all kinds (such as courgettes/zucchini and pumpkins) are all botanically fruit, yet
                    cooked as vegetables.</p>

                <p>The confusion on whether tomatoes are fruits or vegetables has led to legal dispute in the United
                    States.
                    In 1887, U.S. tariff laws that imposed a duty on vegetables, but not on fruit, caused the tomato's
                    status to become a matter of legal importance. In Nix v. Hedden, the U.S. Supreme Court settled the
                    tariff controversy on 10 May 1893, by declaring that the tomato is a vegetable, based on the popular
                    definition that classifies vegetables by use—they are generally served with dinner and not dessert.
                    The
                    holding of this case applies only to the interpretation of the Tariff of 1883, and the court did not
                    purport to reclassify the tomato for botanical or other purposes.</p>

                <h2>TYPES</h2>
                <p>Tomatoes come in different sizes, shapes, and water content, which can help determine what kind to
                    grow
                    and how to use them. Here are some of the most common types:</p>

                <ul type="square">
                    <li><b>Beefsteak tomato: </b>Among the largest fruits, beefsteaks have a juicy, meaty texture and
                        classic flavor. Round, slightly flattened fruits are superior slicers for sandwiches, salads,
                        and
                        caprese</li>
                    <li><b>Campari tomato: </b>Also known as tomatoes on the vine. Golf-ball-sized fruits have low
                        acidity,
                        exceptionally sweet flavor, and juicy texture. Good for snacking, salads, salsa, roasting, and
                        bruschetta.</li>
                    <li><b>Pear tomato: </b>Small pear-shaped fruits have a sweet mild flavor and juicy texture. Plants
                        are
                        heavy producers over a long time. Good for snacking, salads, and preserves.</li>
                    <li><b>Plum tomato: </b>Popular plum tomatoes are Roma and San Marzano. The water content is low and
                        texture is firm, making these a good choice for tomato sauce, paste, roasting, drying, and
                        canning.
                        Fruits are mellow tasting, medium sized, and oval shaped.</li>
                    <li><b>Salad tomato: </b>Rounded fruits, 2-3 inches in diameter, are perfect for slicing on
                        sandwiches
                        or chopped in salads. Somewhat tart and juicy, these have a good balance of acid and sweet.</li>
                    <li><b>Grape tomato: </b>Similar to plum tomatoes but smaller, the oval-shaped fruits grow in
                        clusters
                        similar to cherry types but have a thicker, meatier texture, and milder flavor. Good for
                        snacking,
                        salads, kebabs, and roasting.</li>
                    <li><b>Cherry tomato: </b>Bite-sized rounded fruits that grow in clusters are juicy and sweet
                        tasting.
                        Good for snacking, salads, kebabs, roasting, and quick sauces.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Determinate, indeterminate, or semi-determinate?</h3>
                <p>All tomatoes are either determinate, indeterminate, or semi-determinate. It is important to keep
                    these
                    definitions in mind when choosing what tomatoes to grow—depending on your growing space and how you
                    want
                    to use them</p>
                <ul type="square">
                    <li><b>Determinate: </b>("bush tomatoes")</li>
                    <ul type="rounded">
                        <li>Plant grow 1-3 feet tall</li>
                        <li>Ideal for patios, containers, and small space gardens.</li>
                        <li>Produce one big crop and die off near the end of the growing season.</li>
                        <li>Because fruits ripen all at once, good for larger quantity uses such as canning, sauces, and
                            drying.</li>
                        <li>On plant labels, these will be abbreviated as DET.</li>

                    <li><b>Heirloom: </b>Heirloom tomatoes have been around for hundreds of years. They tend to have the
                        best flavor and come true from seed, which means that you will get the exact same variety from
                        seed
                        saved from the previous year.</li>
                    <li><b>Hybrid: </b>Hybrid tomatoes are a cross between two varieties and bred for particular traits
                        such
                        as disease-resistance and cold hardiness. They can be somewhat less flavorful than heirlooms and
                        will not come true from seed.</li>

                <p>source:NEW YORK POST</p>
                <p>This 52 million-year-old fossil is the world’s oldest tomato</p>
                <p>By Todd Venezia</p>
                <p>Published Jan. 10, 2017, 9:19 p.m. ET</p>
                <center><img src="oldtomato.jpg"></center>
                <p>Scientists searching a prehistoric lake bed in southern Argentina recently uncovered the fossilized
                    remains of a
                    tomato that dates back 52.2 million years.
                </p>
                <p>The discovery of the ancient edible shows that tomatoes have existed some 30 million years longer
                    than researchers
                    previously had thought.
                </p>
                <p>The sample — which was found in an area known as Laguna del Hunco in an area called Chubut, according
                    to the Mirror —
                    is actually thought to be so old that it is likely the ancestor to the potato, the cucumber and even
                    tobacco.
                </p>
                <p>The tomato is similar to the Mexican husk tomato, and it wound up being preserved for eons after it
                    fell into a lake
                    next to a volcano.</P>

                <P> The water had very little oxygen in it, and that helped the fossilization process, the Mirror
                    reported.

                <h2>USES</h2>
                <h3>Culinary</h3>
                <p>
                    Though it is botanically a berry, a subset of fruit, the tomato is considered a vegetable for
                    culinary purposes. It has a strong savoury umami flavour, rather than significant sweetness (see
                    above). Chef Heston Blumenthal observed that the inner pulp had more flavour that the flesh; a
                    subsequent academic study in which he participated confirmed that the pulp had up to eleven times
                    more glutamic acid, which carries umami flavour, than the flesh.
                </p>
                <p>Although tomatoes originated in the Americas, the tomato is now grown and eaten around the world. It
                    is used in diverse ways, including raw in salads or in slices, stewed, incorporated into a wide
                    variety of dishes, or processed into ketchup or tomato soup. Unripe green tomatoes can also be
                    breaded and fried, used to make salsa, or pickled. Tomato juice is sold as a drink, and is used in
                    cocktails such as the Bloody Mary.</p>
                <p>Tomatoes have become extensively used in Mediterranean cuisine as a key ingredient in pizza and many
                    pasta sauces.[6] Tomatoes are also used in Spanish and Catalan dishes, such as gazpacho and pa amb
                    tomàquet.</p>
                <h3>Storage</h3>
                <P>Tomatoes keep best unwashed at room temperature and out of direct sunlight. It is not recommended to
                    refrigerate them as they take a mealy texture and lose flavour.</P>
                <P>Storing stem down can prolong shelf life, as it may keep from rotting too quickly.</P>
                <P>Unripe tomatoes can be kept in a paper bag to ripen.</P>
                <P>Tomatoes are easy to preserve whole, chopped, or as tomato sauce or concentrated paste by home
                    canning. The fruit can also be preserved by drying, sometimes in the sun where climate permits, and
                    sold either in bags or in jars with oil.</P>

            <h3>TOMATO VARIETIES</h3>
            <p>There are more than 10,000 tomato varieties available. Here, I listed sum of them.</p>

            <img src="goodhearted.jpg">
            <figcaption>Good Hearted</figcaption>

            <P>This small plant is perfect for containers, balconies, patios, and small spaces. A good producer with
                cherry-sized
                heart-shaped fruits, juicy texture, and good sweet-to-acid balance. Heat and humidity tolerant,
                disease-resistant,
                and needs no staking or caging.</p>
            <img src="Garden Trasure.jpg">
            <figcaption>Garden Trasure</figcaption>
            <p>This slicing type produces fruit all summer. Developed to have rich heirloom taste with modern
                disease-resistance. Produces medium-sized fruit with a mild balanced flavor, good in salads and sauces.
                Can be grown in containers or the landscape, and will need staking or caging.</p>
            <img src="Garden Gem.jpg" alt="">
            <figcaption>Garden Gem</figcaption>
            <p>The snack-sized fruit was developed to have rich heirloom taste with modern disease-resistance,
                short-season maturity, and high yields. Firm, juicy fruit has a smooth, well-balanced flavor and is good
                for snacking, salads, and roasting. Grow in a container, raised bed or vegetable plot; needs staking or
                caging.</p>
            <img src="San Marzano.jpg" alt="">
            <figcaption>San Marzan0</figcaption>
            <p>This heirloom is a favorite of chefs and avid foodies, widely regarded as one of the best plum tomatoes
                for its superior well-balanced flavor and firm texture. Oval 4-inch long fruits are nearly seedless. Use
                for canning, sauces, and paste. The tall vining stature requires a large cage or trellis for support.
            </p>
            <img src="Big Boy.jpg" alt="">
            <figcaption>Big Boy</figcaption>
            <p>This classic hybrid variety is one of the most popular beefsteak types, with large rich red fruits
                weighing 10-16 oz. Vigorous plants produce blemish-free, crack-resistant fruits. Peak yield is
                mid-season, with continuous fruiting into fall. Needs good support. Use for sandwiches, salads, and
                caprese or cooked as spaghetti sauce.</p>
            <img src="Better Boy.jpg" alt="">
            <figcaption>Better Boy</figcaption>
            <p>An improved version of ‘Big Boy’ and a favorite beefsteak variety. This hybrid produces larger fruits
                with smooth skins weighing up to 1 lb. each. Highly adaptable, with abundant yields mid-summer to frost.
                Especially resistant to wilting diseases. Classic tomato flavor with a perfect balance of sweetness and
                acidity. Good slicers for salads, sandwiches, and caprese. Needs strong support.</p>
            <img src="Celebrity.jpg" alt="">
            <figcaption>Celebrity</figcaption>
            <p>An award-winning hybrid, versatile and low-maintenance with high yields, making it a good choice for
                beginning gardeners. Perfectly rounded crack-resistant fruits weigh 7-10 oz. Sometimes considered
                semi-determinate because fruit is produced from mid-summer until frost. A great all-purpose tomato
                that’s ideal for slicing, salsa, canning, and sauces. Quick maturity rate makes this a good choice for
                short-season climates.</p>
            <img src="Cherokee Purple.jpg" alt="">
            <figcaption>Cherokee Purple</figcaption>
            <p>Consistently ranked as one of the best-tasting heirloom beefsteak types. Rich sweet flavor makes this the
                ultimate BLT slicer. Hefty fruits 5 inches wide weigh 8-12 oz and are distinctly colored. Because of the
                delicate meaty texture and high water content, fruits should be used quickly. Needs strong support.</p>
            <img src="Early Girl.jpg" alt="">
            <figcaption>Early Girl</figcaption>
            <p>One of the earliest fruiting tomatoes, cold-tolerant, and good for short-season climates. Vigorous plants
                bear clusters of 5 oz. meaty fruits early in the season, continuing to produce longer than most other
                varieties. The medium-sized flavorful fruits are good for slicing and cooking. There are both vining and
                bush forms, with bush types suited to containers and small spaces.</p>
            <img src="Sun Gold.jpg" alt="">
            <figcaption>Sun Gold</figcaption>
            <p>One of the most popular cherry types, especially vigorous and prolific. Clusters of exceptionally sweet
                yellow-orange fruits are produced all summer long. Flavor develops before being fully ripened, allowing
                for longer harvest time. Best when eaten right off the vine; use for snacking, salads, vegetable trays,
                tomato pie, canning, and quick roasting. Needs strong support. Good disease-resistance to fusarium wilt
                and tobacco mosaic virus.</p>
